Some scripts use cv2.imshow(). Run those locally in VS Code/PyCharm because a GUI window is required.

# Q1. Read an image using OpenCV and display it
 Approach: Use cv2.imread() to read sample.jpg, then cv2.imshow() to display it.

# Code: 
solutions/q01.py

# Important functions:
cv2.imread(), cv2.imshow(), cv2.waitKey(), cv2.destroyAllWindows().

# Observation: 
OpenCV reads a normal color image as a BGR NumPy array.

# Output: 
outputs/q01_output.png

# Q2. Check whether an image loaded successfully
Approach: After reading the image, check whether the returned object is None.

Code: solutions/q02.py

Important functions: cv2.imread().

Observation: cv2.imread() returns None when the file cannot be read.

# Output:
outputs/q02_output.png

# Q3. Print height, width, and number of channels
Approach: Use the image array's shape property.

Code: solutions/q03.py

Important concept: For a color image, image.shape is (height, width, channels).

Observation: The included sample image is 480 × 640 with 3 color channels.

# Output: 
outputs/q03_output.png

# Q4. Calculate total number of pixels
Approach: Multiply image height by image width.

Code: solutions/q04.py

Important concept: Total pixels = height × width; channels are not multiplied when counting spatial pixels.

# Output: 
outputs/q04_output.png

# Q5. Print the image matrix data type
Approach: Print image.dtype.

Code: solutions/q05.py

Important concept: Standard 8-bit images are usually stored as uint8 values in the range 0–255.

# Output:
outputs/q05_output.png

# Q6. Save the image with another filename
Approach: Read the original image and save a copy using cv2.imwrite().

Code: solutions/q06.py

Important functions: cv2.imread(), cv2.imwrite().

Observation: The pixel data can be written to another image file without changing the original.

# Output: 
outputs/q06_output.png, outputs/q06_saved_copy.jpg

# Q7. Read an image directly in grayscale
Approach: Pass cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE to cv2.imread().

Code: solutions/q07.py

Important function: cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE).

Observation: The resulting array has only two dimensions: height and width.

# Output: 
outputs/q07_output.png

# Q8. Convert a color image to grayscale
Approach: Read the color image and use cv2.cvtColor() with cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY.

Code: solutions/q08.py

Important function: cv2.cvtColor().

Observation: Grayscale conversion reduces three color channels to one intensity channel.

# Output: 
outputs/q08_output.png

# Q9. Display an image using Matplotlib and hide the axis
Approach: Convert BGR to RGB before displaying with Matplotlib, then call plt.axis('off').

Code: solutions/q09.py

Important functions: cv2.cvtColor(), plt.imshow(), plt.axis().

Observation: Matplotlib expects RGB ordering while OpenCV uses BGR.

# Output: 
outputs/q09_output.png

# Q10. Resize an image to 50% width and height
Approach: Calculate half the original width and height and call cv2.resize().

Code: solutions/q10.py

Important function: cv2.resize().

Observation: Reducing both width and height by half reduces the number of pixels to one fourth.

# Output: 
outputs/q10_output.png

# Q11. Access a pixel at a user-provided coordinate
Approach: Read (x, y) from the user and access the NumPy array as image[y, x].

Code: solutions/q11.py

Important concept: NumPy uses row first, so coordinate (x, y) is accessed as [y, x].

Observation: A color pixel returns three BGR values.

# Output example: 
outputs/q11_output.png

# Q12. Modify a selected pixel and save the image
Approach: Validate coordinates and intensity, assign a new pixel value, then save the modified image.

Code: solutions/q12.py

Important concepts: NumPy indexing, cv2.imwrite().

Observation: A single pixel can be changed directly because an OpenCV image is a mutable NumPy array.

# Output: 
outputs/q12_output.png, outputs/q12_modified_pixel.jpg

# Q13. Print B, G, and R values of a selected pixel
Approach: Read a pixel and unpack it as b, g, r.

Code: solutions/q13.py

Important concept: OpenCV color channel order is BGR, not RGB.

# Output example:
outputs/q13_output.png

# Q14. Split a color image into B, G, and R channels
Approach: Call cv2.split(image) and display the returned channel matrices.

Code: solutions/q14.py

Important function: cv2.split().

Observation: Each channel is a grayscale matrix representing the intensity of one color component.

# Output: 
outputs/q14_output.png

# Q15. Merge three image channels into one color image
Approach: Split the image and combine the channels again with cv2.merge([b, g, r]).

Code: solutions/q15.py

Important function: cv2.merge().

Observation: Merging channels in the original BGR order reconstructs the original color appearance.

# Output: 
outputs/q15_output.png

# Q16. Find minimum and maximum grayscale intensity
Approach: Load a grayscale image and use NumPy's min() and max() methods.

Code: solutions/q16.py

Important concepts: gray.min(), gray.max().

Observation: These values show the darkest and brightest intensities present in the image.

# Output: 
outputs/q16_output.png

# Q17. Calculate mean grayscale intensity
Approach: Use gray.mean().

Code: solutions/q17.py

Important concept: The mean gives the average brightness of the image.

# Output: 
outputs/q17_output.png

# Q18. Calculate mean and standard deviation
Approach: Use np.mean() and np.std() on the grayscale matrix.

Code: solutions/q18.py

Important functions: np.mean(), np.std().

Observation: Mean describes average brightness; standard deviation describes spread/contrast of intensity values.

# Output: 
outputs/q18_output.png

# Q19. Create a 256 × 256 grayscale image with intensity 128
Approach: Use np.full((256, 256), 128, dtype=np.uint8).

Code: solutions/q19.py

Important function: np.full().

Observation: Every pixel has the same middle-gray intensity, so the image is uniformly gray.

# Output: 
outputs/q19_output.png

# Q20. Create a grayscale intensity ramp from 0 to 255
Approach: Create values 0...255 with np.arange() and repeat the row using np.tile().

Code: solutions/q20.py

Important functions: np.arange(), np.tile().

Observation: The image gradually changes from black to white across its width.

# Output: 
outputs/q20_output.png

# Q21. Convert an 8-bit grayscale image to 4-bit quantization
Approach: Reduce 256 possible intensity values to 16 levels. The code uses integer division by 16, then maps each level across the 0–255 display range.

Code: solutions/q21.py

Important concept: 4-bit representation provides 2^4 = 16 intensity levels.

Observation: Some fine intensity variation is removed and banding becomes more visible.

# Output: 
outputs/q21_output.png

# Q22. Convert an 8-bit grayscale image to 2-bit quantization
Approach: Reduce 256 values to 4 levels and map them to approximately 0, 85, 170, 255.

Code: solutions/q22.py

Important concept: 2-bit representation provides 2^2 = 4 intensity levels.

Observation: Much more visual detail is lost than in 4-bit quantization.

# Output:
outputs/q22_output.png

# Q23. Downsample the image by a factor of 2
Approach: Resize to half the width and half the height using cv2.INTER_AREA.

Code: solutions/q23.py

Important functions: cv2.resize(), cv2.INTER_AREA.

Observation: Spatial resolution is reduced from 640 × 480 to 320 × 240 for the sample image.

# Output:
outputs/q23_output.png

# Q24. Crop a rectangular ROI using user-provided coordinates
Approach: Read (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), validate them, then use NumPy slicing: image[y1:y2, x1:x2].

# Code: solutions/q24.py

Important concept: Cropping does not require a special OpenCV function because image arrays support slicing.

Observation: Only the selected rectangle remains in the ROI image.

# Output example: 
outputs/q24_output.png

# Q25. Rotate an image by 90 degrees and save it
Approach: Use cv2.rotate() with cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE, display it, then save it.

Code: solutions/q25.py

Important functions: cv2.rotate(), cv2.imwrite().

Observation: After a 90° rotation, width and height exchange positions.

# Output: 
outputs/q25_output.png, outputs/q25_rotated_90.jpg
